I'm Taiz, a small-time programmer from Tennessee. Aspiring game developer, writer, and artist.

## Things I've Written
Regular blog posts are [here](https://taizweb.github.io/post/index.html), while developmental posts are [here](https://taizweb.github.io/devlog/index.html).

## Things I've Made
[Heartbeat](https://github.com/TaizWeb/heartbeat), a game engine built on top of Love2d. Includes a physics engine, built-in level editor, level reader/writer, dialog framework, and entity/tile framework. Typically used for platformers.

[Project Proton](https://github.com/TaizWeb/project-proton), a game built in the Heartbeat engine as part of a 30 day gamejam. It's a short 20-30 minute metroidvania, with builds for all major operating systems. I consider this my first "proper" game.

[Lua Markdown Converter](https://github.com/TaizWeb/markdown-converter/blob/master/converter.lua), a quick markdown-\>html converter that I personally use on my blog. I don't see _that much_ reason to use it over any other existing converters unless you're running a lua back-end for a blog.

## What I'm Currently Working On
My biggest project yet. I'm not trying to reveal too much about it before I have more concrete things in place, but I'll be announcing it on my devlog as soon as it's where I'd like it to be. I have no idea when it'll be done given how busy my life is with other obligations, but there is steady progress.
